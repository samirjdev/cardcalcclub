# Open Graph Image (OG Image)

For rich link previews in iMessage, social media, and other platforms:

1. Save your OG image as `og-image.png` in this `public` folder
2. Recommended size: **1200x630px** (1.91:1 aspect ratio)
3. Format: PNG or JPG
4. The image should be clear and readable at small sizes

The image will be automatically used for:
- iMessage link previews
- Facebook/LinkedIn shares
- Twitter/X cards
- Other social media platforms

Make sure the image represents your app well - it's the first thing people see when you share the link!
